title: Why I want to become a developer
---
Computers always interested me since I was young. I remember I love to go to my neighbor's house when I was little to play Doom on his Mac. Even though there was nintendo and sega something about the computer fascinated me.

6 Months ago I didn't know how to become a developer. So I started by playing with freecodecamp. To learn about the power of programming in these short few classes is amazing. I love learning new things and with programming the learning is endless. The basics skills I learned so far listed below is just the tip of the iceberg of what I plan to use in the future. 

* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Angularjs
