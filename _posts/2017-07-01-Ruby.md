title: Ruby on Rails

I have been using Ruby on Rails for about 3 months now and I love it. So much better then Javascript. Something about creating databases fascinates me. Building a blog with comments using Ruby on Rails is a foundational exercise I went through to learn more about the framework. Working together, both Ruby and Rails lend us a hand to generate a fairly simple MVC pattern built on top of a CRUD approach when working with dynamic data.
