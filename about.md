I am a former financial advisor currently studying computer software engineering principals. I worked as a advisor at Prudential for 3 years when I realized that working with data is what got me excited at my job. I started studying the basics of computer programming over a year ago and then formally enrolled in Bloc in December 2016. Since I was more interested data I picked a program that not only taught how to become a programmer but also the computer engineering principals as well. It is really interesting to see how data structures and algorithms work.

Some background I went to Ohio State for my undergrad and while I was there 9/11 occurred. Being a native New Yorker many people I know were affected by this tragedy. I joined the US Army a year later as a combat medic. I have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2007 and Hurricane Katrina. The military has taught me to be discipline and focused which is important while learning how to become a software engineer.

I love sports especially football and basketball. In my free time I take my dog Matcha to the dog park and try to workout by mostly running when the time allows it.
